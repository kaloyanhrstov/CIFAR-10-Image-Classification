# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project involves the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Two separate CNN models (model1 and model2) are trained independently on the CIFAR-10 training dataset. 
Subsequently, a federated learning approach is employed to merge these two models into a single model. The merging process involves averaging the parameters of the two models. The performance of the individual models, as well as the merged model, 
is evaluated through testing on the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
